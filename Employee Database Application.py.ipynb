    "### I. In this assignment you will create an employee database application by fulfilling the requirements given below. You must first create the classes as described. Then write a driver program that will use these classes to build an application for an Employee Database. All employee data is stored in a file called empdata.dat.\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. Each time you run the program, the user is allowed to repeatedly select from the four choices described below:\n",
    "1. Add a new employee\n",
    "2. Print all employee data for all the employees in the file\n",
    "3. Compute and print the employee name and compensation of all employees\n",
    "4. Print the employee name with vehicle information vehicles with mileage greater than 78000 miles\n",
    "5. Exit the application\n",
    "\n",
    "### III. The first time you execute the program, your file will have no employees in it. Second time onwards, all employee data from previous executions of the program, should be available\n",
    "#### Parent Class: Employee\n",
    "Create a base class Employee that has the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Employee’s name (String)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Employee’s address (String)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Vehicle data (Vehicle).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Child Classes\n",
    "The child classes FullTimeEmployee, HourlyEmployee and Consultant that inherit from Employee have the following additional properties\n",
    "\n",
    "• FullTimeEmployee – salary (double).\n",
    "\n",
    "• HourlyEmployee - hoursWorked (int) and hourlyRate (double).\n",
    "\n",
    "• Consultant – hoursWorked (int) and ProjectType (valid values are 1, 2, and 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "• All these classes have the 'init' method as well as the get and set methods. In addition, they have additional methods required to complete the application as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### IV. Compenstion Calculation\n",
    "Compensation for each employee type is to be computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Full-Time Employee\n",
    "\n",
    "• FullTimeEmployee: Compensation is salary minus taxes. Taxes are calculated based on the tax rate as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Salary: 45, 000 or less ---> Tax: 18 percent\n",
    "\n",
    "• Salary: > 45,000 and <= 82,000 ---> 18 percent for the first 45000, 28 percent for the rest\n",
    "\n",
    "• Salary: > 82,000 ---> 18 percent for the first 45000, 28 percent for the amount between 45000 and 82000, and 33 percent for the rest\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hourly Employee\n",
    "HourlyEmployee: Compensation is hoursWorked times hourlyRate for the first 40 hours. For hours in excess of 40 hours the hourly rate is 1.8 times the regular hourly rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consultant\n",
    "Consultant: Compensation is hourlyRate times the hours worked. HourlyRate for Consultants is computed based on the ProjectType as given in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Project Type: 1 ---> HourlyRate: 55.00 dollars\n",
    "\n",
    "• Project Type: 2 ---> HourlyRate: 70.00 dollars\n",
    "\n",
    "• Project Type: 3 ---> HourlyRate: 85.00 dollars\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### V. Vehicle Class\n",
    "The Vehicle class is as described below: It has four instance variables – make, model, year of manufacture and mileage. It should have a constructor (__init__ method ) which accepts values for all of the instance variables. You may use aggregation or composition to include a Vehicle object to your Employee data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### VI. Driver Program\n",
    "Now write a driver program to do the following:\n",
    "1. Accept input for new Employees\n",
    "2. Display employee information (including vehicle information) for all the employees that are there in the system.\n",
    "3. List the name of the Employees along with the compensation received by each.\n",
    "4. Display the employee name together with the make, model and mileage of all vehicles whose mileage is greater than 78000 miles.\n",
    "5. Exit the system after writing all information to a file.\n",
    "Any employee data from earlier executions of the application must be available in subsequent executions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### VII. Additional Requirements:\n",
    "• Your program should use exception handling to validate user input for the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Numeric values for year of manufacture, mileage, salary, hours worked and hourly rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The only acceptable values for project type are 1, 2 or 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "• If the user enters invalid values for any of the variables above, print an appropriate message and ask the user to re-enter a valid value.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Your program should also ensure that the user enters valid values for the menu options as well as the choice of employee type. If the user enters incorrect options for either the menu option or the pet type, your program should display an appropriate message and display the menu or the choice of employee types again."
